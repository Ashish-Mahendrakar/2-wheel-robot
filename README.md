# 2-Wheel Robot ROS2 Project

## Overview

This repository contains the files necessary for a 2-wheel robot using ROS2. It includes URDF, launch files, and YAML configuration files for the robot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ROS2 installed (e.g., ROS2 Foxy, Humble, or later)
- Gazebo simulator installed (compatible version with ROS2)
- Required ROS2 packages (e.g., `ros2_control`, `ros2_controllers`)


### Configuration

- The `config/` directory contains YAML files for controller configuration and other parameters. Adjust these files as necessary for your robot's specifications.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are installed and correctly sourced.
- Check ROS2 and Gazebo logs for error messages.
- Consult the ROS2 documentation for additional help with simulation and configuration issues.
